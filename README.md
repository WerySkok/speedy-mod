# Speedy Mod

Simple serverside mod for Fabric 1.18.2 that adds ``/speed`` command.

Usage:
```
/speed <speed> [<type>] [<player>]
```

This command requires OP level 2 or ``speedy.speed`` permission to apply it for yourself and ``speedy.speed.others`` permission to use this command on other players.

This mod includes [fabric-permissions-api](https://github.com/lucko/fabric-permissions-api).

**This mod was made for [Minecraft Urban Railway Server](https://murs-mc.ru) that is aimed at the post-Soviet construction and European architecture. Make sure to check it out!**
